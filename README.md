## Context

We are Solinum, a french NGO dedicated to homelessness cause. We builded an online guide ![Soliguide](https://soliguide.fr/) that is basically the yellow pages for people in need, we reference all the places where homeless people can access basic need services like hygiene, food, healthcare...
The key to for our guide to work is the quality of the data, in order to keep the high quality of it, we use a mix of user submitted info and human moderation.
This is where airtable comes handy for us, We use it as a CRM to follow up on the quality of our data and store extra information like personal phone numbers or email of people in charge of the services we reference.

## why building a custom block

As this is the main tool our local developers use in their day to day activities, we decided to create this custom block to improve their work process by automatically accessing the preview/edit available on our website of the Airtable record they are working on. This make their work easier, it ended up their new tab nightmare but also reduced the time they take to update one services.
